# CoffeeMachine
Java Tutorial `https://github.com/seycileli/CoffeeMachine`

### About:
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break?

A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.

In this project, you will work on programming a coffee-machine simulator.

The machine works with quite typical products:

Coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups
IF it runs out of something, it shows a notification.

The machine can make three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte.

Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

### Result
This project allows you to get a taste of Java. An important part of Java are classes, and this is what you will practice here.

Try yourself at working with loops and conditions and get more confident in Java programming.

Stage #1: Hello, coffee!
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: Give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

### Description:

Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee – virtual coffee, of course.

But in this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of milk, it can run out of coffee beans, it can make different varieties of coffee, and it can take the money for making a coffee.

The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. It prints to the standard output what it is doing as it makes a coffee.

Output example:
Using the "Hello, World!" program, write the program that prints all lines as in the example below.

Starting to make a coffee

Grinding coffee beans

Boiling water

Mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans

Pouring coffee into the cup

Pouring some milk into the cup

Coffee is ready!

## Stage #2: Machines have needs
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

### Description:

Now let's consider a case where you need a lot of coffee. Maybe, for example, you’re hosting a party with a lot of guests. The program should calculate how much water, coffee beans, and milk are necessary to make the specified amount of coffee. One cup of coffee made on this coffee machine contains 200 ml of water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffee beans.

The user should input the amount of coffee he needs, in cups, for all the guests.

Of course, all this coffee is not needed right now, so at this stage, the coffee machine doesn’t actually make any coffee.

### Output example
The example below shows how your output might look.

Write how many cups of coffee you will need: 25

For 25 cups of coffee you will need:

5000 ml of water

1250 ml of milk

375 g of coffee beans

OR;

Write how many cups of coffee you will need: 125

For 125 cups of coffee you will need:

25000 ml of water

6250 ml of milk

1875 g of coffee beans
