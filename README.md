# CoffeeMachine
Java Tutorial `https://github.com/seycileli/CoffeeMachine`

### About:
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break?

A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.

In this project, you will work on programming a coffee-machine simulator.

The machine works with quite typical products:

Coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups
IF it runs out of something, it shows a notification.

The machine can make three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte.

Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

### Result
This project allows you to get a taste of Java. An important part of Java are classes, and this is what you will practice here.

Try yourself at working with loops and conditions and get more confident in Java programming.

Stage #1: Hello, coffee!
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: Give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

### Description:

Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee – virtual coffee, of course.

But in this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of milk, it can run out of coffee beans, it can make different varieties of coffee, and it can take the money for making a coffee.

The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. It prints to the standard output what it is doing as it makes a coffee.

Output example:
Using the "Hello, World!" program, write the program that prints all lines as in the example below.

Starting to make a coffee

Grinding coffee beans

Boiling water

Mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans

Pouring coffee into the cup

Pouring some milk into the cup

Coffee is ready!
